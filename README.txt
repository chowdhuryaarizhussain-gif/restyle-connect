ReStyle Connect - Local Demo
===========================

What this is:
- A working single-page website that runs entirely in your browser.
- No server required. Data is stored in your browser's localStorage.
- Features: designer list, filters, add designer, send project (upload image), simulated designer proposals,
  accept proposal -> create order -> simulated payment -> designer marks delivered -> user rates.

How to run:
1. Unzip restyle_connect.zip
2. Open index.html in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3. Try adding a designer, sending a project, accepting proposals, paying and rating.

Files:
- index.html  : main page
- styles.css  : styling
- app.js      : app logic (all client-side)
- README.txt  : this file

Notes:
- Images and data stay in your browser. Clearing browser storage will remove data.
